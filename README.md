# Founder & Cross-Vertical Operator Case Studies

I've built across a lot of different industries. This repo is a collection of 
that work — product invention, brand launches, manufacturing coordination, and 
frontline selling. The through line isn't the industry, it's the execution.

## 1. Provisional Patent – Footwear Securing Device

### Had an idea, figured out how to build it, and filed it.

Honestly it started because I wear my Air Force 1's loose — shoutout Nelly — and the tongue would always slip sideways and the heel would flop off my foot mid-stride. Annoying enough that I started thinking there had to be a fix. So I sketched out an idea for a device that would keep the tongue centered and lock your foot into the shoe even without lacing up, drove to Michaels craft store while visiting family in Washington, and built the first prototype on the spot.
It actually worked. So I filed it.

Enter: [Tongue Tassels](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/25554691/Tongue.Tassels.pdf)

### The invention includes:

- Insole-integrated strap system
- Dual tension clamp mechanism
- Multi-tooth clamping plates
- Locking and ladder-lock adjustment system
- Adhesive base stabilization

Took it from sketch to spec — mechanical ideation, technical drafting, 
prototype coordination, and formal patent documentation.

## 2. Nutraceutical Brand Development

Built and launched a white-labeled nutraceutical brand from scratch — 
formulation selection, supplier sourcing, packaging, compliance positioning, 
and go-to-market. Immunity-focused formulations and branded supplement SKUs.

This one required a lot of coordination across people who don't normally talk 
to each other:

- Manufacturing partners
- Label compliance standards
- Packaging and identity design
- Direct-response positioning
- SKU launch logistics

### Capabilities Demonstrated
- Vendor negotiation and sourcing
- Brand architecture and positioning
- Compliance-aware packaging development
- Product commercialization
- Margin-aware execution

## 3. Direct Revenue Execution – Live Policy Placement

I build systems but I also sell. This is a real call — full life insurance 
policy placement from cold intro to application complete. Rapport, needs 
discovery, value framing, objection handling, close. No edits, no theory.
